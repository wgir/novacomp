Buid a java library taking as reference the file docs/requirements.md and following the rules defined in docs/rules.md

on PushSenderTest create test case where  projectid is null and test case where serviceAccountKeyPath

examine SmsSenderTest and complete all cases that can exists

examine EmailSenderTest and complete all cases that can exists

add slack channel and add slack case in NotificationExample

generate SlackSenderTest with all cases 

How can I extend this library to allow the selection of one of multiple providers? For example, if there are two email providers and the user of the library can select one to send an email.
